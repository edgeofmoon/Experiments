# Experiments
Program used to visualized brain diffusion tensor data, including
1) tractography visualization;
2) volume rendering of Fractional Anisotrophy field;
3) contour tree based topology visualization & comparison of brain Fractional Anisotrophy field;
4) GLSL based shading of brain cortex mesh as spatial reference;
5) cross-sectional visualization of Fractional Anisotrophy field in place with brain cortex mesh.
